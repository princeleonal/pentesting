<h4> IP Address is classified into two types:  </h4>

While Configuring IP Address To A Computer, Can Set Any One Of Below Types, simultaneously You Cannot Set Both

1.  Static
2.  Dynamic

<h4> Static IP:  </h4>

In Static IP Need To Assign A IP Address Manuly, And No Two or More Computers Are Should Have Same IP Address This Can Cause IP Conflict. Computer In A Network Should Identifed By Unique IP Address.

<h4> Dynamic IP:  </h4>

    In Dynamic IP, Assigning IP Address To A Computer, Is Assigned Automatically By DHCP Protocol.

    Here DHCP Can Used By Any One Of The Method:

        1.Router
        2.DHCP Server

<h2> IpAddress: </h2>

    Ipaddress is reffered as internet protocol it has two versions

    They are:

    1. ipv-4 (32 bit [dec] )
    2. ipv-6 (128 bit [hex] )

<h2> Converting decimal to binary (32 bit) ipv-4: </h2>

           2^7     2^6       2^5       2^4     2^3      2^2     2^1      2^0
           128  |   64   |   32    |   16   |   8    |   4   |   2    |  1

<h4> Decimal Format: </h4>
            
    192.168.1.1
            
<h4> Solving: </h4>

    | octet1 | octet2  |  octet3 |  octet4
       192   .  168    .    1   .    1

    step1:

        128+64 = 192 => 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 of 1st Octet

    step2:

        128+32+8 = 168 => 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 of 2nd Octet

    step3:

        1 = 1 => 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 of 3rd Octet

    step4:

        1 = 1 => 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1  of 4th Octet

<h4> Binary Format: </h4>
        
    1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 . 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 .  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 .  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1
