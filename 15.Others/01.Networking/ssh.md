SSH Public Private Key Auth:

    On Linux:

    ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "tim@debain"

    On Apple-MAC:

    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "tim@mac"

    Where:
            
        -t -> Is Used To Select Algoritm
                ex:
                
                -t rsa
                -t dsa
                -t ecdsa
                -t ed25519
                
        -b --> Key Size


Store SSH Key In Specific File:

    ssh-keygen -f ~/tatu-key-ecdsa -t ecdsa -b 521

    -f --> Specify Path To Store The Key

SSH Remote Port Forwarding:

    ssh -R 8080:localhost:9999 root@example.com

    where

        8080 is remote port

Connecting FTP through SSH:

    ssh -f -L 8080:ftp.example.ie:21 root@example1.com -N

SSH Socks5 Proxy Tunneling With Dynamic Ports:

    ssh -fNn -D 8080 root@example.com

    ps -ef | grep

    lsof -i

Command and Option Summary:


    -b “Bits” This option specifies the number of bits in the key. The regulations that govern the use case for SSH may require a specific key length to be used. In general, 2048 bits is considered to be sufficient for RSA keys.

    -e “Export” This option allows reformatting of existing keys between the OpenSSH key file format and the format documented in RFC 4716, “SSH Public Key File Format”.
    
    -p “Change the passphrase” This option allows changing the passphrase of a private key file with [-P old_passphrase] and [-N new_passphrase], [-f keyfile].
    
    -t “Type” This option specifies the type of key to be created. Commonly used values are: - rsa for RSA keys - dsa for DSA keys - ecdsa for elliptic curve DSA keys
    
    -i "Input" When ssh-keygen is required to access an existing key, this option designates the file.


    -f "File" Specifies name of the file in which to store the created key.

    -N "New" Provides a new passphrase for the key.

    -P "Passphrase" Provides the (old) passphrase when reading a key.

    -c "Comment" Changes the comment for a keyfile.

    -p Change the passphrase of a private key file.

    -q Silence ssh-keygen.

    -v Verbose mode.
    
    -l "Fingerprint" Print the fingerprint of the specified public key.

    -B "Bubble babble" Shows a "bubble babble" (Tectia format) fingerprint of a keyfile.

    -F Search for a specified hostname in a known_hosts file.

    -R Remove all keys belonging to a hostname from a known_hosts file.

    -y Read a private OpenSSH format file and print an OpenSSH public key to stdout.
