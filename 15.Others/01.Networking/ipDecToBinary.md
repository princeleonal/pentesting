<h2> IpAddress: </h2>

    Ipaddress is reffered as internet protocol it has two versions 
    
    They are:
    
    1. ipv-4 (32 bit [dec] ) 
    2. ipv-6 (128 bit [hex] )
    
    
    
<h2> Converting decimal to binary (32 bit) ipv-4: </h2>

           2^7     2^6       2^5       2^4     2^3      2^2     2^1      2^0

<h4> Solving: </h4>

    | octet1 | octet2  |  octet3 |  octet4
       192   .  168    .    1   .    1
    
    step1: 
    
        128+64 = 192 => 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 of 1st Octet
        
    step2:
    
        128+32+8 = 168 => 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 of 2nd Octet
        
    step3:
     
        1 = 1 => 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 of 3rd Octet
    
    step4: 
    
        1 = 1 => 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1  of 4th Octet
